## Notes on the project

CLTV:CLV/CLTV is the average monetary value of each customer for a business.Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) represents the total amount 
of money a customer is expected to spend in a business during his/her lifetime. This is an important metric to monitor because it helps 
to make decisions about how much money to invest in acquiring new customers and retaining existing ones.

CLTV=Avg order value*avg purchase freq*avg customer lifetime

RFM=Recency, Frequency and Monetary value
RFM is a customer segmentation technique that segments customers based on their purchasing habits.

Recency: How recently a customer made a purchase

Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase

Monetary Value: How much money a customer spends on a purchase

RFM analysis numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The "best" customer would receive a top score in every category.
